### Project: Titanic Survival Prediction
"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" is a kernel from Kaggle which focuses on exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning. There are many secrets to be revealed beneath the Titanic dataset. In this paper, we tried to find out some of those unknown factors that had affected the survival of passengers when the Titanic was sinking, and also to predict which passengers survived the tragedy with machine learning tools. As a result, we achieved a prediction with over 80% accuracy rate.
